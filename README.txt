# HybridIoT

HybridIoT is a Multi-Agent System for estimating missing environmental values in large scale context. HybridIoT allows coping with the lack of environmental information at large-scale by using mobile and intermittent  devices. 
The proposed system allows:

- estimating missing environmental information at large-scale whereas *ad hoc* sensors are not available;
- exploiting mobile and intermittent devices to avoid the installation of *ad hoc* sensors;
- integrating heterogeneous environmental data at real-time. 

The following libraries are required
	- Apache commons (math, csv, collections, lang)
	- slf4j
	- logback-classic
	- commons-(cli/io)
